# Milestone3 README

#### Why did you choose to test the code that you did? 
- I tested the code which includes python files for server and typescript files for client
to examine each unit of my code separately so that when application is ran at production level, it does not
fail. Testing single unit in python files make sure that each pieces runs correctly and when all those pieces are 
joined together results in a working program. With unit test I tested individual parts of my code to see if observed 
behavior is consistent with the expectations and so if failed indicates there is some problem in system under test.
The testing also works when not online as the test are designed to mock the online access of the code. 
#### Is there anything else you would like to test if you had the time
- All the test I did covered most of the files in my project and I don't think there's anything left more testing.
 If I had more time I could fix few typescript errors which I ignored in one of the component.
